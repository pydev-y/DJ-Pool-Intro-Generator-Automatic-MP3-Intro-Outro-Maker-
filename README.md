# 🎧 DJ Pool Intro Generator (Bulk MP3 Intro Maker)

Automatically create professional **DJ pool–style intros** for MP3 music files.

This tool extracts the song’s real groove (**drums + instrumental**) and generates a clean, countable intro:

> **1–2–3–4 loop (1 bar) repeated 8 times**  
with smooth DJ transitions — just like DJ pool edits (MMP / Intro Clean).
